	    		<p class = "about"> Hello, I'm Christopher Harding and I'm an aspiring web developer. Before I got into web developing, I went to college at Temple University studying accounting.  After I graduated, I was applying to a lot of accounting jobs. Unfortunately, most jobs that I applied to didn't give me the opportunity I wanted. Few years later, I felt that accounting wasn't the career path and I wanted to switch my career. I did some researching on which is the best career switching move and web development comes into mind. I learned that web developnment has better work/life balance, flexible hours, and it's fun to be creative. Plus, I spent most of my time online (I guess that maybe the reason why I want to be a web developer). I don't have the experience in web development, but I'm willing to learn new skills to become a better developer. </p>
