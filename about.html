	    		<p class = "about"> Hello, I'm Christopher Harding and I'm an aspiring web developer. Before I got into web developing, I went to college at Temple University studying accounting.  After I graduated, I was applying to a lot of accounting jobs. Unfortunately, most jobs that I applied to didn't give me the opportunity I wanted. During that time, I worked at a freight forwarding company named Besco Shippers Inc. My tasks are shipping miscellaneous goods to destinations around the Caribbean, doing bookkeeping monthly and quarterly, and taking phone calls from customers who want to ship. Few years later, I felt that accounting wasn't the career path for me and I wanted to switch my career. I did some researching on which is the best career switching move and web development comes into mind. I learned that web developnment has better work/life balance, flexible hours, and it's creative. Plus, it's more fun. I don't have the experience in web development, but I'm willing to learn new skills to become a better developer. </p>
